We live in the age of big data. It is difficult to give an exact definition of big data. However, as a good rule of thumb, if the dataset can't fit in memory or disk on a single system, it can be called big data. Big data is used in areas such as healthcare, biology, bioinformatics, and education.
Big data has fundamentally changed data analytics. Home computers were sufficient to analyze small and medium-sized data. But big data has changed the game. Home computers failed to analyze big data because big data didn't fit in memory.
Cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure have been developed to analyze big data. Now we can easily analyze big data using cloud computing.

## üî• What is BigQuery?

BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that allows you to manage and analyze your data with built-in features like machine learning, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence. You can query terabytes in seconds and petabytes in minutes with BigQuery.

### BigQuery ML functionality is available by using:

- The Google Cloud console
- The bq command-line tool
- The BigQuery REST API
- An external tool such as a Jupyter notebook or business intelligence platform

## üî• What is Dataproc?

Dataproc allows you to manage Spark and Hadoop services that let you take advantage of open-source data tools for batch processing, querying, streaming, and machine learning. 

Dataproc automation enables you to create clusters quickly, manage them easily, and save money by turning clusters off when you don't need them. You can focus on your jobs and data with less time and money spent on administration.

### Here are some advantages of Dataproc:

- Low cost 
- Super fast 
- Integrated - You can use Dataproc with other Google Cloud Platform services, such as BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Logging, and Cloud Monitoring.
- Managed - You can easily interact with clusters and Spark or Hadoop jobs through the Google Cloud console, the Cloud SDK, or the Dataproc REST API.
- Simple and familiar

## üî• What is Dataflow?

Dataflow is a fully managed service for executing data processing pipelines written using Apache Beam. Dataflow provides serverless, autoscaling service for programmatic data pipelines. 

Unlike with Cloud Dataproc, you don‚Äôt need to spin up a cluster to perform data processing. Instead, you simply submit the code and it will get executed and autoscaled to as many machines as needed to accomplish the task effectively.
