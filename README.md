We live in the age of big data. It is difficult to give an exact definition of big data. However, as a good rule of thumb, if the dataset can't fit in memory or disk on a single system, it can be called big data. Big data is used in areas such as healthcare, biology, bioinformatics, and education.
Big data has fundamentally changed data analytics. Home computers were sufficient to analyze small and medium-sized data. But big data has changed the game. Home computers failed to analyze big data because big data didn't fit in memory.
Cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure have been developed to analyze big data. Now we can easily analyze big data using cloud computing.

**This repository contains the BigQuery codes that I covered on my youtube channel.**

BigQuery ML functionality is available by using:

- The Google Cloud console
- The bq command-line tool
- The BigQuery REST API
- An external tool such as a Jupyter notebook or business intelligence platform
